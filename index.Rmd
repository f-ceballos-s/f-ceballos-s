Prior to starting my PhD, I grew coffee in my personal farm, and held field agronomist and extension agent positions across Colombia that exposed me to the social and economic issues faced by rural communities. I took these issues to the [Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://ace.illinois.edu/) and build a research agenda that provides evidence-based tools for addressing the challenges of climate variability for coffee cultivation, proposes novel methods for technology diffusion that leverage within-family channels of information exchange, and improves the understanding of the impact of conflict resolution processes on legal and illegal economic activity in rural areas. Simultaneously, I have led grant-writing activities that gave way to research projects in Nicaragua and the International Center for Tropical Agriculture in Colombia. 

**I am on the 2020-2021 Job Market, and available for interviews.**
